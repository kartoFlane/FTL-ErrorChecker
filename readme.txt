Installation:
  - Unpack the program anywhere (if you're reading this, you probably already completed this step, good job!)

Running:
  - _Don't_ double-click on the .jar file. Use one of the launchers instead:
  * For Windows users:
    - Double-click on run.bat. If that doesn't work, make sure Java is installed correctly.
  * For Linux/Mac users:
    - Double-click on run.command or run.sh
    - If that doesn't work, open the Terminal, drag one of those files onto it, and press Enter.

Setup:
  - When running for the first time, the program will attempt to find FTL installation.
    Most of the time this should be located automatically, and you'll only be asked for confirmation,
    but in the rare case that it fails, you'll have to locate FTL installation yourself.

How to use:
  - Install the mod you wish to check with SMM.
  - Run the ErrorChecker (or, if it's already running, press the "refresh" button)
  - Press the "parse" button

There are some errors in FTL's vanilla files that are not your mod's fault -- you can ignore
them, they're mostly harmless. If you can't distinguish between them and those caused by your
mod, run the Checker against clean, unmodded FTL first.
