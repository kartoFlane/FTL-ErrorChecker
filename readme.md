FTL ErrorChecker
================

FTL ErrorChecker is a tool used to find obscure errors and mistakes in mods for the game FTL: Faster Than Light.
The compiled program itself only provides the user interface, as well as file scanning, and data storage facilities, relying on an external, scripted database to make sense of the collected data, and check whether the mod contains any errors.
